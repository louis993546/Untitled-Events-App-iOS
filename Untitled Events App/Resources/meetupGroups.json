We want to create a forum where you can easily meet with people interested in German/Italian conversation exchange, to talk, to help each other improve the language you are learning, share language-learning experiences, and generally have fun and make new friendships. No matter what level you have in German/Italian, everybody is welcome to join us. &lt;br&gt;</p> \n<p>We will meet regularly, e.g. on Sunday afternoons for coffee and talks, brunch, perhaps day trips etc. Please feel free to make suggestions on what kind of events you would be interested to attend (discussion about specific topics, reading a book together, just to socialize, hanging out together, going to the movies, dinners...).</p> \n<p>Looking forward to seeing you! :) &lt;br&gt;</p>",

Grakn is a hyper-relational database that allows you to perform knowledge engineering to manage this complexity. Effectively, Grakn provides a Knowledge Base (aka. Knowledge Graph) as the core foundation of intelligent systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Grakn provides an intelligent query language, Graql: Grakn’s reasoning (through OLTP) and analytics (through OLAP) query language, which is a much higher-level abstraction over traditional query languages. This allows intelligent systems to benefit from an intuitive language the provides&nbsp;an expressive schema for knowledge modelling, reasoning transactions for real-time inference, distributed algorithms for large-scale analytics, and optimisation of query execution. Grakn also provides the logical integrity of SQL, the scale of relationships of Graph databases, and the horizontal scalability of NoSQL. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this community, we discuss the underlying technology and applications of the Grakn hyper-relational database. We will also discuss the techniques of a new software engineering principle, Knowledge-Driven Development, that Grakn now enables. The group is for engineers to demonstrate their solutions and share the lessons they learnt, as well as business leaders to learn applications of Grakn in their business.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Building on the success of our 5,000+ members in San Antonio Texas and Stuttgart, Germany, we are a group of locals, internationals and visitors alike who aren't afraid of thinking while drinking.</p>\n<p>We are dedicated to the following:</p>\n<p>Open Communication <br>In Person Social Networking <br>Adventures <br>Community Involvement <br>Good Times with Great People</p>\n<p>We are open to anyone with an open mind, drive for new ideas and of course a friendly liver.</p>\n<p>We are currently offering this meetup in English only, but will soon being offering in Deutch as well.</p>\n<p>//Ian &amp; Co.</p>\n<p>**********Reviews of our group:</p>\n<p>* I was new to San Antonio and eager to find a fun, interesting crowd. Enter T&amp;D under the inspired leadership and direction of one Ian C. Perry. It's been a 18 months of great conversations, killer hangs and hilarious misadventures. And I met my best friends and boyfriend through the meetup! These are my kinda people. -- Sherry, 38, Tennessee</p>\n<p>* Thinkers n Drinkers has been a fascinating experience for me. It is a discussion group with a wide range of topics and a diverse group of people that NEVER got heated. Even though the topics can be controversial and polarizing, no one was ever shouted down or became visible angry, only diplomatic and personal conversations. Thinkers n Drinkers is a safe space where one can speak and share freely. Ian is a fantastic facilitator that sets a space that is open and inclusive. All perspectives are welcomed, encouraged and nurtured. The community created through Thinkers n Drinkers lives on outside of the weekly meetings through friendships and adventure outings. Thanx Ian!!!! -- Alexei, 37, Texas</p>\n<p>* Drinkers and thinkers is a place that challenges your thinking and to learn about perspective. I always loved being intrigued by other people's opinions and learn more about the topic of that night. I am more of a listener than a talker but it did make me more confident in speaking and not being judged. Its a great group that I got to experience a few times. -- Juanita, 19, Colorado * The best part about this group is getting to meet really cool people. You get share and express your ideas and opinions on different topics of life and also welcome in new ideas you may never have thought about before. Plus the drinking part is always fun. -- Lacey, 26, Florida</p>\n<p>* It all started a couple years ago with a discussion on what defined happiness. Since being hooked by that enlightenment, I have enjoyed many discussions (with beer in hand) over subjects ranging from relationships and religion to success and money. Sometimes broad like \"What is success\". Sometimes specific like \"Is monogamy necessary in a relationship\". I always thought the taboo topic of politics would have made things interesting for the diverse/open minds in the group, but maybe it would have led to unfriending on Facebook, so better left unspoken and we all stay Thinkers, Drinkers and Friends. -- Joe, 63, Texas</p>\n<p>* Moving across the country is like any big change in life. Finding yourself in new surroundings and meeting new people is simple enough however, most often you find yourself having superficial conversations and making light acquaintances. Thinkers and Drinkers was a breath of fresh air. I found myself surrounded by people who like me wanted to have meaningful conversations, people who wanted to delve deeper than the normal light chat we all find in a bar. The group breaks down the barriers by combining fun, social activities like meeting in bars, camping, outdoor activities, coupled with honest exploration of a variety of topics. <br>I would highly recommend this to anyone searching for good conversations and great friends. -- Jason, 38, Connecticut</p>\n<p>* Diverse, witty, brain stimulating, and headed by the most awesome Meetup organizer. I miss it tremendously and might move to Stuttgart. Wait no more and join the fun. -- Ikram, 35, Morocco</p>\n<p>* A friend invited me to a Thinkers and Drinkers meet-up. I don't drink, so I was a bit doubtful. I am SO glad I went! The conversation was wonderful, and the people even more so. I've since gone on multiple camping trips and other various T and D events, made new friends, connections, and a slew of inside jokes. The events are always well-organized, and the founder, Ian, is a total hoot. You are and always will be welcome, and he makes sure you know it :) -- Kara, 29, New York</p>\n<p>Connect:</p>\n<p>Instagram: @ThinkersDrinkersInternational</p>\n<p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thinkersdrinkersinternational/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/thinkersdrinkersinternational/</a></p>\n<p>Podcast: <a href=\"https://www.spreaker.com/user/thinkersdrinkersinternational\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.spreaker.com/user/thinkersdrinkersinternational</a></p>\n<p>Email: ThinkersDrinkersInternational@gmail.com</p>",

We also do exercises and proofs together, at first silently everyone alone and then at the whiteboard together. It's all about gaining thorough understanding of the underlying theory to ML: Active participation is highly encouraged, including asking questions that deepen your understanding. There is no homework, but if you join in the middle of a chapter it's advisable that you get familar with the previous pages. <br></p>\n<p>Although we are in the middle of a book, you can join at any time, as the chapters are very independent. The only requirement to succesfully do this is that you have a background in machine learning theory. A common way to achieve this is to having attended a course on Machine Learning. <br></p>",
